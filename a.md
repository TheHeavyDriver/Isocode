## Client

Company A, Jabalpur. Distributor for 4 packaged food and home care brands, serving 1,800 kirana shops. 70 staff including 18 salesmen, revenue ₹85–100 crore a year.

## Today

Salesmen write orders in notebooks, or retailers send WhatsApp texts, photos of handwritten lists and Hindi voice notes. Next morning an office team of 6 types them into Tally. Salesmen don't know stock or schemes at the counter, so lines are cut later.

## The problem

Assumptions: 600 orders a day, 300 days, ₹5,000 per order, so ₹90 crore a year. 5% of orders have a wrong item or quantity needing a return or redelivery: 1,80,000 × 5% = 9,000 × ₹350 = ₹31.5 lakh. Order entry staff: 6 × ₹2.6 lakh = ₹15.6 lakh. Stock-outs found after ordering lose 1% of sales at 6% margin: ₹90 lakh × 6% = ₹5.4 lakh. Total ₹52.5 lakh a year.

## Users

Retailers (shop owners on phones), salesmen, and the office order desk. The owner-director signs the deal.

## The ask

My shopkeepers already order on WhatsApp, each in their own way, and my office retypes it all. I want a simple app where a retailer sees stock, his price and the current scheme, and orders in a minute. Salesmen should use it in the shop, even without signal. Messages and voice notes should become orders my desk only has to check.

## Must have

    Installable web app with OTP login, catalogue, retailer prices and schemes, stock status, repeat order and credit limit
    Salesman mode for orders during visits, working offline
    AI order capture from text, a photo of a list, or a Hindi voice note
    Scheme engine for free goods (buy 10 get 1) and slab discounts
    Order desk with credit holds, Tally export and van loading lists
    Dashboard of retailers with no order in 14 days

## Core build

Software Engineering candidates must ship this slice end to end, in about 6 to 8 screens: retailer catalogue with prices and schemes, cart and order, AI capture from a text order, and order desk with Tally export. Roles: retailer and order desk. AI: order capture from messages. Hard part: the scheme engine. Mock payments, messages and outside systems, and seed from the sample data. The rest of MUST HAVE is optional depth.

## Out of scope

    Delivery tracking
    Payments in the app
    GST e-invoicing (stays in Tally)

## Ai or automation

AI reads text, photos and voice notes and maps items to SKUs using the retailer's past orders. When it is wrong: each line shows the original words, a confidence level and two alternative SKUs, and unclear units (case or piece) are asked, not guessed. No order is placed until a person confirms it, and desk corrections become aliases for that retailer.

## Constraints

Retailers use low-end phones on slow 3G: first load under 3 seconds, large tap targets. Hindi and English. Prices must show clearly whether GST is included. A retailer's prices and credit are visible only to them, their salesman and the desk.

## Design

The client values good, minimal design: clean layouts, white space, a restrained palette and clear type, with nothing on screen that lacks a purpose. Design counts as much as features. Shopkeepers order between customers: a fast, uncluttered catalogue with large images, clear prices and a quick cart.

## Budget and time

₹7 lakh, 6 weeks. Success: 50% of orders placed in the app or captured by AI in 4 months; orders with errors from 5% to under 1%; order entry team from 6 to 3.
